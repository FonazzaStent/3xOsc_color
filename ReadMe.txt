3xOsc color calculator 1.0.0

A color calculator for the 3xOsc synth built in all copies of FL Studio from Image-Line.
The program will take channel values for an RGB color as an input and output volume parameters for each
oscillator on the 3xOsc synth found on all copies of FL Studio from Image-Line. Volume values for
Triangle, Square and Sine waveshape correspond to the Red, Green and Blue channel of the color. The
highest volume value will be set on the top oscillator (Oscillator 1), where no volume control is
provided. Set this oscillator to the corresponding waveshape and the other two to the other
waveshapes, adjusting volumes as shown by the program.
Clone the synth with these settings and set its main volume to the volume shown by the program after
the "Clone synth specified above" message.
When played in a track with other presets, this presets will transfer to the brain the subliminal
synesthetic sensation of that particular color.
